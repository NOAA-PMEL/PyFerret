! benchmark for Vis5D external function
! 5/99 ACM


!  Write data to a Vis5D file.  The first argument to the 
!  GO script is the file, arguments 2 through 9 are variable names to be written.
! 7/2007 Funtion doesnt want to write a variable that doesnt have a vertical variation.
!        To get a basic test of the function, make some data on a regularly-spaced xy grid.
