! When the time origin is specified in a NetCDF file as 
! "10-JUN-1996 04:03:36", the seconds are read incorrectly. 
! If it's written as "1996-06-10 04:03:36" it is read OK

use time_axis_seconds.nc

sp "ncdump time_axis_seconds.nc | grep origin"
list t[gt=height]    ! Seconds should be 36, 37, 38...
