# If you are installing FERRET for the first time at your site we ask
# that you please notify us with an Internat mail message to
# ferret@noaapmel.gov [192.68.161.0] (or call Steve Hankin at (206)526-6080)
# - no strings attached.  Please specify if you would like to be on a mailing
# list for FERRET updates.
#
# Modify this to suit your system and place the result as file `ferret_paths'
# in another directory set up to hold login initialization scripts.
# `/usr/local' is the suggested choice.
# Users of FERRET should include the command 
#  `source /usr/local/ferret_paths'
# (or wherever you have located the ferret_paths file) in their .bash_profile.
#
# The environment variable FER_DIR should be the pathname of
# the directory named `ferret' you created to install the FERRET software.

# You may want to customize the pathname of the `ferret' directory:
export FER_DIR=/usr/local/ferret

# The environment variable FER_DSETS should be the pathname of
# the directory named `fer_dsets' you created to install the FERRET program.

# !!!! You must customize the following line:
# This directory will contain FERRET demonstration data files (30+ Mbytes)
export FER_DSETS=my_big_data_disk/fer_dsets



# System Manager: Check this PATH modification for your system security.
# If you prefer not to modify PATH here you may comment out the following few
# lines and execute the file $FER_DIR/bin/install_ferret_links wich will
# create ferret links in /usr/local/bin.
export PATH="$PATH $FER_DIR/bin"
# *** end of PATH modifications
 
# =========== Initially make no modifications below this line ===========
