# AFTER you execute (source) the generic ferret_paths
#
# example:  (in your .login file)
# source /usr/local/ferret_paths    (or wherever your system mgr. has put it)
# source $HOME/my_ferret_paths

# These are the environment variables you may wish to customize.
# They are currently set up on the assumption that all your FERRET
# work is done in the directory $HOME/ferret .
