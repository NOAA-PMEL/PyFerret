## This Bourne-shell script is used to initialize and run Ferret using 
## the pyferret Python module.  The intent of this script is to provide 
## a traditional Ferret interface through the pyferret Python module.

## set python_exe to the (optionally full-path) python executable to use
python_exe="##PYTHON_EXECUTABLE##"

## Make sure the FER_* environment variables are assigned
if [ -z "${FER_DIR}" ]; then
## Either source the ferret_paths script to assign the environment variables
    . "##FERRET_PATHS_SH_SCRIPT##"
## or just throw an error if they should have already been defined
#   echo "**ERROR: Ferret environment variables are not defined"
#   exit 1

## The pyferret assignment to PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
## is now done in the ferret_paths script.

## Execute an in-line Python script to run Ferret using the pyferret 
## module.  The init method explicity processes the $PYTHONSTARTUP file, 
## if it exists and if '-secure' was not given as a command-line argument.
