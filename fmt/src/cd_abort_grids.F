* NOAA/PMEL, Seattle, WA - Tropical Modeling and Analysis Program

* revision 0.0 - 2/92
* Linux port -kob - 3/97 - Modify include for tmap_dset.parm to be a
*			   preprocessor include for F90 - needed because
*			   tmap_dset.parm contains an ifdef
* V500: 7/99 *sh* - bug fix: need conosotent use of char_init16 on line_name
