<H2>Welcome to the Ferret user community!</H2>

<P>This installation guide assumes the installer is familiar with
the UNIX system. He or she must be familiar with the file system
of the target computer, and may need system privileges if installing
Ferret in a root-owned directory.</P>

<P>If you install this software we ask you to please notify <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#111;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#112;&#109;&#101;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#95;&#102;&#101;&#114;&#114;&#101;&#116;&#64;&#110;&#111;&#97;&#97;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;">
        &#111;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#112;&#109;&#101;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#95;&#102;&#101;&#114;&#114;&#101;&#116;&#64;&#110;&#111;&#97;&#97;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118; </a> and
indicate what type of computer system you are using. We've also
formed a Ferret Users Group so that</P>

<UL>
  <LI>we can let you know of significant new developments and Ferret releases.<BR>
  <LI>Ferret users can share questions and solutions.
</UL>

 <P>To join, simply follow the instructions at 
 <A  HREF="http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/email-users-group">Users Group and Archives</A><BR>

<BR>
<P><A NAME="Downloading"></A></P>

<H2>Downloading the tar files</H2>

<P>You will require approximately 150 Mbytes of disk space (depending on O.S. type) 
  to install Ferret, preferably on your `<CODE>/usr/local</CODE>' file system. 
  Another 85 Mbytes are needed on a disk device to install the demonstration data 
  sets. If disk space is a problem, the section <A HREF="#Reducing_Disk_Space">Reducing 
  Disk Space Required</A> in this installation guide provides assistance with 
  which files are safe to delete.</P>

<P>The Ferret distribution is made up of three gzipped tar files:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>fer_executables.tar.gz (Ferret and utilities)
  <LI>fer_environment.tar.gz (support files)
  <LI>fer_dsets.tar.gz (sample data sets)
</UL>

<P>All three of these files need to be placed on your system.
After acquiring them, follow the steps below to install the application.
<A NAME="Installing_Support"></A></P>

<H2>Installing support files</H2>

<OL>
  <LI>Determine a suitable location on your file system to install
  the Ferret program and its support files. The location we recommend
  is `<CODE>/usr/local</CODE>'. You will need 150 Mb available there.
  From there, create the directory `<CODE>ferret</CODE>', and change
  directory to it. <!pre------>
  <UL>
    <P><CODE>% cd /usr/local</CODE> <!i------>(our recommendation,
    but it's your choice)
    <P><CODE>% mkdir ferret<BR>
    % cd ferret<BR>
    </CODE>
  </UL>

  <P>This guide will use the name <CODE>$FER_DIR</CODE> to refer
  to this directory (`<CODE>/usr/local/ferret</CODE>' -- or your
  choice, if different).</P>

  <LI>The file `<CODE>fer_environment.tar.gz</CODE>' holds the Ferret
  support directories and associated files. To install the file
  <pre>% tar xzf $GET_LOCATION/fer_environment.tar.gz</pre>
  where <CODE>$GET_LOCATION</CODE> is the directory you put the
  gzipped tar file in when getting it via ftp. Be sure you're
  in the <CODE>$FER_DIR</CODE> directory when you run this command.
  When that's done, running `<CODE>ls</CODE>' in that directory
  should give the following listing: 
  <pre>% ls -1F 
  bin/ 
  contrib/
  examples/ 
  ext_func/ 
  go/ 
  ppl/ </pre>
  </LI>
  <LI>Now determine a location on your file system suitable for
  Ferret's sample data files. You'll need 85 Mb available. From
  there create a directory `<CODE>fer_dsets</CODE>', and change
  directory to there.
  <UL>
    <P><CODE>% cd ...</CODE> (for example, `<CODE>/home/data_disk</CODE>')<BR>
    <CODE>% mkdir fer_dsets<BR>
    % cd fer_dsets<BR>
    </CODE>
  </UL>
  <P>This guide will refer to this directory by the name <CODE>$FER_DSETS</CODE>.
  <LI>Extract the sample data set directories from their gzipped
  format: <pre>% tar xzf $GET_LOCATION/fer_dsets.tar.gz</pre>
  Again, <CODE>$GET_LOCATION</CODE> is the directory where the
  tar file resides. Be sure to be in <CODE>$FER_DSETS</CODE> when
  running this command. Executing `<CODE>ls</CODE>' from that directory
  should give the following listing: 
  <pre>% ls -1F 
  data/ 
  descr/
  grids/ </pre>
</OL>

<P><A NAME="Installing_Executables"></A></P>

<H2>Completing the installation with Finstall</H2>

<P>After these directories are created, two steps complete the
installation of Ferret, and you can begin using it. There is a
shell script called `<CODE>Finstall</CODE>' to help you with these
two tasks. (One other step documented in the section Setting Up
the Hard Copy Environment sets up easy printing of hard copy from
Ferret plots.)</P>

<P>The Finstall script is in the `<CODE>bin</CODE>' subdirectory
of <CODE>$FER_DIR</CODE> (where you put the Ferret support files)
and can be invoked by referencing the complete path to it:</P>

<UL>
  <P><CODE>% /usr/local/ferret/bin/Finstall</CODE> (for example)
</UL>

<P>Finstall will then ask you to select from two options, corresponding
to the remaining steps:</P>

<OL>
  <LI><A NAME="install_executables"></A><B>Install executables:</B><BR>
    This option extracts files from the gzipped tar file `<CODE>fer_executables.tar.gz</CODE>'. 
    You'll want to run this option if you're installing Ferret for the first time, 
    and also if you're updating a Ferret you already have. 
    <P>When these files are extracted by Finstall they're placed in `<CODE>$FER_DIR/bin</CODE>'; 
      the two files extracted are the Ferret program itself (`<CODE>ferret</CODE>') 
      and the program that translates Ferret's graphics metafiles to PostScript 
      for hard copy (`<CODE>gksm2ps</CODE>'). 
    <P>To install the executable: 
    <OL>
      <LI>Select Option 1 after invoking Finstall. 
      <LI>Finstall prompts you for the directory you installed the Ferret support 
        files in (<CODE>$FER_DIR)</CODE>. Enter the complete path to that directory. 
      <LI>Finstall prompts you for the directory you currently have the fer_executables 
        tar file in (<CODE>$GET_LOCATION</CODE>). Enter the complete path to that 
        directory. 
      <LI>Finstall then installs the executables in `<CODE>$FER_DIR/bin</CODE>'. 
    </OL>
  <LI><A NAME="customize_ferret_paths"></A><B>Customize `<CODE>ferret_paths</CODE>':</B><BR>
    This option modifies the `<CODE>ferret_paths_template</CODE>' script to set 
    environment variables FER_DIR and FER_DSETS to the directories at your site 
    where the Ferret software and demonstration data were placed. The modified 
    file is written out as `<CODE>ferret_paths</CODE>' and placed in a directory 
    you will be asked to specify.
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Beginning with Ferret v6.7 the Ferret install procedures will run under the csh or bash shell with no modification.
	  Prior to that version, note that the file ferret_paths_template was created using 
        c-shell syntax. For users of either the bash shell (bash) or the korn 
        shell (ksh), there are appropriate ferret_paths_template files in $FER_DIR/bin. 
        Before running Finstall to customize ferret_paths, be sure to copy the 
        correct template file for your shell to ferret_paths_template. If you 
        are using a completely different shell, use ferret_paths_template as a 
        guide to creating a template customized for your specific Unix shell.</p>
      <p>We rrecommend that the new ferret_paths file not 
        be placed anywhere inside of the<CODE>$FER_DIR</CODE> directory tree. 
        Modifications inside of <CODE>$FER_DIR</CODE> may cause complications 
        when future versions of Ferret are installed. Instead, we recommend that 
        the new file be created in `<CODE>/usr/local</CODE>' or another directory 
        that will be in the users' PATH variable. This guide will refer to that 
        directory by the name <CODE>$SET_FER</CODE>. The `<CODE>ferret_paths</CODE>' 
        file, after it's customized, may be used to set up the users' environment 
        to run Ferret (For more detail, see the explanation in `<CODE>$FER_DIR/bin/ferret_paths_template</CODE>'). 
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    To customize `<CODE>ferret_paths</CODE>': 
    <OL>
      <LI>Select Option 2 after invoking Finstall. 
      <LI>Finstall prompts you for the directory you installed the Ferret support 
        files in <CODE>$FER_DIR</CODE>. Enter the complete path to that directory. 
      <LI>Finstall prompts you for the directory you installed the Ferret sample 
        data files in (<CODE>$FER_DSETS</CODE>). Enter the complete path to that 
        directory. 
      <LI>Finstall prompts you for the directory you wish to place the <CODE>ferret_paths</CODE> 
        file in <CODE>$SET_FER</CODE>. Enter the complete path to that directory. 
      <LI>Finstall then creates `<CODE>ferret_paths</CODE>' in the directory you 
        specified. 
    </OL>
    <P>After the `<CODE>ferret_paths</CODE>' file customization is complete, execute 
      the Ferret setup procedure with the command 
    <pre>% source $SET_FER/ferret_paths</pre>
</OL>

<P>Access to Ferret and its supporting routines is through the
addition of `<CODE>$FER_DIR/bin</CODE>' to your PATH environment
variable. This addition will be done automatically when the command
`<CODE>source $SET_FER/ferret_paths</CODE>' is issued.</P>

<P>Ferret can now be run by entering</P>

<PRE>
    % ferret</PRE>

<P><A NAME="Setting_up_GKS"></A></P>

<H2>Setting up your display environment</H2>

<P>To get graphical output from Ferret at your workstation, you
must have the X Windows environment variable DISPLAY defined properly.
Check whether your DISPLAY variable is alresdy set,

<PRE>
    % printenv DISPLAY</PRE>

If you system is called anorak, then the response might be <CODE>anorak:0.0</CODE> or, depending on your environment, something like <CODE>localhost:10.0</CODE>. 

If DISLPAY is not set, then set the variable to point to the workstation screen where you want Ferret graphical output displayed. In the example below graphics
output will be sent to the screen of workstation <CODE>anorak</CODE>.</P>

<PRE>
    % setenv DISPLAY anorak:0.0</PRE>

<P>Ferret supports X Window graphical output, and PostScript is
used to provide hard copy of plots. Images can also be saved as &quot;gif&quot; files. <A NAME="Documentation"></A></P>

<H2>Documentation</H2>
<P>The Ferret User's Guide and on-line release notes are available at <A HREF="http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/documentation">http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/documentation</A>
</P> 

<P>Additional on-line documents, such as FAQ's and on-line tutorials,
are also available at the URL above. 

<P>For a productive and smooth start using Ferret, review the
Demonstration Files section of the Ferret User's Guide. Tutorial scripts 
demonstrating Ferret data sets and usage
are documented there. We recommend trying them out first. A Ferret beginner 
will want to scan the first 6 chapters of the Users Guide for introductory 
information.</P>

<P>In addition, the tutorial scripts (journal files) in `<CODE>$FER_DIR/examples</CODE>'
are excellent source material for your own scripts. Copy any or
all to your own area and print out, study and modify them to suit
your needs.</P>
<A NAME="Reducing_Disk_Space"></A></P>

<H2>Reducing Disk Space Required</H2>

<P>Various directories and files may be deleted if disk space
is a concern. Below is an outline of the considerations for deletable
directories.</P>

<P>You may selectively delete some of the data files in `<CODE>$FER_DSETS/data</CODE>'.
Others are essential for creating land outlines and masks and
climatological axes. Note that deleting data sets from this directory
will cause some of the demonstration scripts distributed with
Ferret to break. Data sets which may be removed that will only
effect the demonstration scripts, listed from minimum to maximum
effect, are esku_heat_budget, monthly_navy_winds, levitus_climatology
and coads_climatology. etopo5 may also be removed, however LAS depends on
it for making maps.</P>

<P><A NAME="Setting_up_an_Account"></A></P>

<H2>Setting up an account to run Ferret</H2>

<P>To set up a user account to run Ferret (C-shell only) add the
following line to the `<CODE>.login</CODE>' file for that account:</P>

<UL>
  <P><CODE>% source $SET_FER/ferret_paths</CODE> (see <CODE><A
  HREF="#customize_ferret_paths">Customize_ferret_paths</A></CODE>)
</UL>

<P>To properly set up the account to produce plots and other graphs,
a user must have set the environment variable DISPLAY, as explained
above. This can be done by using the `<CODE>setenv</CODE>' command
in the user's `<CODE>.login</CODE>' file, for example:</P>

<PRE>
    % setenv DISPLAY anorak:0.0</PRE>

<P><A NAME="Special_Environment_Variables"></A></P>

<H2>Special Environment Variables and Files</H2>

<P>The three environment variables FER_DATA, FER_DESCR, and FER_GRID
have been set up to point to the sample data sets included with
Ferret. Each of these defines a path to the files Ferret needs
to properly access data sets. The pathlist can be expanded to
suit your needs. In particular, FER_DATA may be a path to directories
residing on several devices; thereby allowing data sets to be
large, quite possibly spanning more than one file system. (NetCDF
files are pointed to by FER_DATA.)</P>

<P><A NAME="Shared_Object"></A></P>

<P>The environment variable FER_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS
by default is set to point to $FER_DIR/ext_func/libs, where the
external function sharable object libraries that are distributed
with Ferret reside. Add additional paths to this list as needed
to point to other repositories of Exernal Functions</P>

<P>With new releases of Ferret, functions originally developed as external 
functions are linked into the Ferret executable. This makes them available 
to users whose systems don't allow for the use of shared object files. If 
you are upgrading to a new version of Ferret you may wish to clean out shared 
object files from the FER_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS directory, making sure to save any 
functions you have written or installed yourself.

<P>As you become more familiar with Ferret through use and reading
documentation, you may want to modify these pathlists from the
way they are now defined in the script `<CODE>ferret_paths</CODE>'.
A file in directory `<CODE>$FER_DIR/bin</CODE>' called `my_ferret_paths_template'
will help with this. See the section in the Ferret user's guide
covering UNIX account set up for that optional modification.</P>

<P>Ferret also uses an optional initialization file, `<CODE>.ferret</CODE>',
located in the user's $HOME (login) directory. This file, if it
exists, will be executed automatically each time Ferret is started
up, permitting Ferret to be tailored to individual needs and styles.
The format of the file is like any other Ferret &quot;GO&quot;
file -- an ASCII file of Ferret commands, one command per line.
<A NAME="Setting_up_Hard_Copy"></A></P>

<H2>Setting up the Hard Copy Environment</H2>

<P>Hard copies can be made from Ferret plots very easily.</P>

<P>Plots must be saved on disk as &quot;metafiles&quot; before
hard copy can be made; the GKSM metafile format is used to record
Ferret plots on disk. To create metafiles, within a Ferret session,
invoke the Ferret command `<CODE>SET MODE META</CODE>'. Subsequent
plots will be saved in metafiles. To cancel recording of plots,
specify `<CODE>CANCEL MODE META</CODE>'. The metafiles will by
default be named `<CODE>metafile.plt</CODE>' and sequential, emacs-style
version numbers are used to uniquely identify each plot file by
appending a suffix of `<CODE>.~nnn~</CODE>', where <CODE>nnn</CODE>
is a unique version number.</P>

<P>There is a shell script supplied with Ferret, in the `<CODE>$FER_DIR/bin</CODE>'
directory, that both translates the metafiles to PostScript and
routes the resulting files to a printer. You'll usually use the
script -- modified slightly to include the printers at your site
-- to print Ferret plots. (For consistency at Ferret installations,
we ask that if you use the script you retain the syntax outlined
below for its use. Feel free to modify the syntax and give it
another name, or write new scripts; but please use a different
command name in that case.)</P>

<P>The example script is named `<CODE>Fprint_template</CODE>'.
The modified file should be called `<CODE>Fprint</CODE>' and placed
in a directory that will be in a user's PATH (we suggest `<CODE>/usr/local</CODE>').
As with the `<CODE>ferret_paths</CODE>' file (see section Customize
`ferret_paths') we strongly recommend the edited file not be placed
in the $FER_DIR directory tree. Please look in the `<CODE>Fprint_template</CODE>'
file for instructions to help you add your site's printers to
the script. There is an Fprint document in the `<CODE>$FER_DIR/doc</CODE>'
directory suitable for general use as a guide to Fprint's syntax.</P>

<P>The command Fprint has a syntax allowing specification of the
printer to be used and the metafiles to be processed. Invoking
`<CODE>Fprint -help</CODE>' will give u sage information. `<CODE>Fprint</CODE>'
uses as default the printer named by the environment variable
PRINTER; or the destination printer can be named: Here are a few
examples:</P>

<UL>
  <P><CODE>% Fprint metafile.plt*<BR>
  % Fprint -P </CODE><I>printer_name</I><CODE> metafile.plt*<BR>
  % Fprint -P </CODE><I>printer_name</I><CODE> metafile.plt.~3~
  metafile.plt.~7~<BR>
  </CODE>
</UL>

<P>The first example sends files `<CODE>metafile.plt*</CODE>'
to the default printer (determined by environmen t variable PRINTER),
the second sends all `<CODE>metafile.plt*</CODE>' files to `<I>printer_name</I>',
and the last sends the indicated plots to that same printer.</P>

<P>Fprint can be used to translate a metafile and output the result
to a disk file in PostScript format; Fprint also renders metafiles
on a X Window workstation for review.</P>

<P>Hard copy of a plot is generated by Fprint in two steps:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>conversion of the device independent GKS metafile to PostScript,
  the well-known page description language
  <LI>routing the PostScript file to a particular device.
</OL>

<P>The conversion is done by the command `<CODE>gksm2ps</CODE>',
which is supplied with Ferret. Both its syntax and examples of
use are given in the Ferret User's Guide. An example of its use
to convert one plot file (`<CODE>metafile.plt</CODE>') to a PostScript
file (`<CODE>gksm2ps_output.ps</CODE>') is:</P>

<PRE>
    % gksm2ps -o gksm2ps_output.ps metafile.plt</PRE>

<P>Routing that file to a printer could be done manually with:</P>

<PRE>
    % lpr -s gksm2ps_output.ps</PRE>

<P><A NAME="Update_install"></A></P>

<H2>Updating your Ferret installation</H2>

<P>The Ferret system has two components, the environment -- or
support -- files, and the executables. We may add enhancements
to the two parts independently. If Ferret was installed at your
site months ago, or you receive Ferret User Group listserver email
announcing an update, consider updating your installation. Here's
how you can update either or both components: </P>

<A NAME="Update_environment"></A>
<H2>Updating the environment files</H2>

<P>The update contains recent enhancements, usually including Ferret scripts adding new capabilities, demonstration scripts, color palettes, and more. The latest update to the environment files is in the distribution directory for each system we support, and named</P>

<PRE>
     fer_environment.tar.gz (support files)
</PRE>

<P>To install the updated versions of the environment files, please follow the instructions above in the section <A HREF="#Installing_Support">Installing support files</A>. If you have made modifications to files such as scripts or palette files, you will want to save those to another directory and use the environment variables FER_GO and FER_PALETTE to point to these directories as well as the default Ferret locations. The environment file for a Ferret release is system independent. (This is true starting with the release of Ferret version 6.7 and higher.)</P>

<P><A NAME="Update_executables"></A></P>

<H2>Updating the Ferret executables</H2>

<P>The file 'fer_executables.tar.gz' in the distribution directory holds the ferret and gksm2ps programs that you picked up when you first installed Ferret. In addition it contains compiled external functions and font files which are specific to the operating system. It also contains the ThreddsBrowser jar file. We update these with enhancements and bug fixes periodically.</P>

<P>The Ferret Downloads page lists the version of ferret available. If the 
version is higher than what you have, you will benefit from picking up the update and installing it. To find the version of Ferret you have installed, run</P>

<PRE>
    % ferret</PRE>

<P>When ferret starts up it will list the version number and operating system, e.g.,<BR>

<PRE>
    FERRET v6  
    Linux(g77) 2.4.21-32 - 08/23/06
</PRE>

In addition, after Ferret starts, the symbols ferret_version, netcdf_version, and ferret_platform are defined and contain the pertinent information about that particular Ferret executable and the version of the netCDF library that it is linked with.</P>

<PRE>
    yes? SHOW SYMBOL ferret_version
    yes? SHOW SYMBOL netcdf_version
    yes? SHOW SYMBOL ferret_platform
</PRE>
<P>
You can determine the version
of gksm2ps you have by running</P>

<PRE>
    % gksm2ps -v</PRE>

<P>The application will respond with, e.g., &quot;Version number of gksm2ps: Mod 1.03&quot;.</P>

<P>To update these files:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Get the fer_executables.tar.gz file in binary mode.
  <LI>As in your original installation, run the script <pre>% Finstall
  (it is in your directory $FER_DIR/bin) </pre>
  <OL>
    <LI>Select Option 1 after invoking Finstall.
    <LI>Finstall prompts you for the directory you installed the
    FERRET support files in ($FER_DIR). Enter the complete path to
    that directory.
    <LI>Finstall prompts you for the directory you currently have
    the fer_executables.tar.gz file in. Enter the complete path to
    that directory.
    <LI>Finstall then installs the executables in $FER_DIR/bin.
  </OL>
</UL>
