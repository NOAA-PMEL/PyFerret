'''
Defines the abstract base class for bindings to the graphics calls
from PyFerret.  Specific engine bindings should create a subclass of
AbstractPyFerretBindings and re-implement the methods to call the 
methods or functions for that engine.  This class definition should 
then be registered with PyFerret (pyferret.graphbind.addPyFerretBindings).

When PyFerret creates a Window for an engine, it first creates an
instance of the appropriate bindings class and then calls the 
"createWindow" method on that instance.  Thus instance variables
will be for the one window associated with the bindings instance.
